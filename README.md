This folder contains 5 sample DSA problems with solutions and short example usage.

Files:

- `1_two_sum.py` : Two Sum — hash-map solution.
- `2_reverse_linked_list.py` : Reverse a singly linked list (iterative).
- `3_binary_search.py` : Binary search — **contains a deliberate mistake** (see the comment inside the file).
- `4_max_subarray.py` : Maximum subarray (Kadane's algorithm).
- `5_graph_dfs.py` : DFS traversal (recursive and iterative).

Run a file to see its example output, e.g.:

```powershell
python "d:\Technical\Python\Sample Testing Repo\dsa_problems\1_two_sum.py"
```

Note: `3_binary_search.py` has an intentional bug so you can practice finding/fixing it. The comment in the file is labelled `DELIBERATE MISTAKE`.
